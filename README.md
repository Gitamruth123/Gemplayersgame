In the 2D console game "Gem Hunters," two players aim to collect the most gems within a limited number of turns on a 6x6 grid. 
Player 1 starts at the top-left corner, while Player 2 starts at the bottom-right corner. 
The board includes three key elements: immovable obstacles (O), empty spaces (-), and gems (G), which are randomly placed at the game's start.
Players move one square at a time using commands for up (U), down (D), left (L), and right (R) to gather gems.
When a player moves onto a square containing a gem, they collect it, and the square becomes empty.
Each player takes 15 turns alternately during the 30-turn game.
After each move, the board shows the players' current positions, gems, obstacles, and empty spaces. 
Players can only move in non-diagonal directions and cannot pass through obstacles.
The game concludes when all turns are completed, and the winner is the player who has collected the most gems.
The game ends in a tie if both players collect the same number of gems.
